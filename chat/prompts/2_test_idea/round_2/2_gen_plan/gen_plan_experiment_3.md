<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EXPERIMENT

EXPERIMENT
Run code to test hypotheses, implement methods, and collect empirical results.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any pip package), isolated workspace, gradual scaling (mini → full data).

Capabilities: Implement and run any code-based experiment, compare method vs baselines.
Deps: REQUIRED at least one DATASET | OPTIONAL RESEARCH for methodology guidance
</artifact_type_info>

<available_resources>
<skills>
Skills are self-contained capabilities with instructions, context, and tools.

</skills>

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_qY2a2IS-WLIs/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_qY2a2IS-WLIs/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_qY2a2IS-WLIs/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_qY2a2IS-WLIs/3_invention_loop/iter_2/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Write the workspace path of each kept artifact into your results and your
`README.md`, so the paper can cite it by path rather than by a link that
was never pushed.

<prompt>
<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Do sentence and formula generalize the same way?
hypothesis: |-
  A candidate FOL formalization is faithful to its sentence only if the two share the same MONOTONICITY SIGNATURE. This signature records, for every concept the sentence mentions, whether the sentence stays true when that concept is made more general (upward), stays true when it is made more specific (downward), both (the concept is irrelevant, i.e. vacuous), or neither. It also records which concept fills each argument slot of each relation (ROLE ANCHORING). Both sides can be measured with the SAME substitution experiment. (i) On the formula, a solver checks exactly, for each predicate P, whether P ⊆ P' ∧ F(P) ∧ ¬F(P') and P ⊆ P' ∧ F(P') ∧ ¬F(P) are unsatisfiable on finite structures, and whether restricting relation slot i to a unary predicate A ever changes F. (ii) On the sentence, a behavioural probe asks a mid-size LLM English-to-English entailment questions between the sentence and copies of it in which one concept is specialized ('dogs' → 'brown dogs', 'provider' → 'European provider'). The LLM never sees any formula. Because the formula-side signature is a semantic property, it is by construction invariant to logical equivalence, variable and predicate renaming, reordering, and most granularity choices (for example 'UntrainedDog(x)' vs 'Dog(x) ∧ ¬Trained(x)'). So it scores correct-but-gold-inequivalent formalizations as faithful. The mismatch vector is a gold-free faithfulness score and also names the error type:
  - one concept's sign flipped → negation/polarity error;
  - restrictor turned from downward to upward → ∀/∃ error;
  - restrictor and scope signs swapped → reversed implication / 'only' error;
  - a sentence concept with no non-vacuous predicate → dropped condition;
  - a predicate with no sentence concept, or a vacuous one → added condition;
  - swapped slot anchors → swapped arguments;
  - two concepts with different signatures merged into one predicate → conflation;
  - one concept split into predicates with opposite signs → wrong split.
  Mechanistic prediction: the signature has one coordinate per concept, so its detecting power GROWS with the number of conditions and exceptions, while whole-formula judges (LLM-as-judge, round-trip) degrade with length. This predicts a crossover in which the signature beats the judge on long, heavily conditioned sentences. The theory also predicts its blind spots in advance: pure quantifier-scope permutations and cardinality errors leave the signature unchanged, so detection of those should sit at chance. That is a falsifiable part of the claim.
motivation: >-
  NL→FOL evaluation is blocked on gold formulas that are scarce, often wrong (about 39% of FOLIO and 36% of MALLS formalizations
  are incorrect per arXiv:2606.02837), and not unique. Every gold-free alternative in use either checks form rather than meaning
  (parse rate, arity consistency, undefined predicates, run-to-run Jaccard — the user's pilot metrics) or asks an LLM to compare
  a whole formula or its back-translation with the text: round-trip (arXiv:2604.25031), Monty's clause conformance (arXiv:2607.13303),
  LLM-as-judge. Those whole-formula comparisons share the formalizer's blind spots and degrade on long, nested, exception-laden
  sentences, which are the sentences that matter in legal and regulatory text. Monotonicity is the one piece of meaning that
  natural language marks overtly (determiners, negation, 'unless', 'except', 'only', conditionals) and that FOL fixes exactly.
  That makes it a gold-free common currency between text and formula which is exact on the formula side, blind to vocabulary
  choice, and local, so it scales with sentence complexity. If the hypothesis holds, practitioners gain: a cheap per-output
  metric that needs no gold, no ontology and no per-formula LLM call; a per-output error-type diagnosis; and a way to flag
  wrong gold annotations in public benchmarks. The text-side probes are computed once per sentence and reused across every
  candidate and system. If it fails, the failure is informative, because the design separates the text-side probe accuracy
  (validated on the MED/HELP monotonicity sets) from the formula side (exact by construction). The result therefore shows
  which half of the text↔formula bridge is the bottleneck.
assumptions:
- >-
  Predicate names produced by NL→FOL systems are usually lexical echoes of sentence words, so concepts can be aligned to predicates
  by lemma overlap, with an embedding fallback. Where alignment fails, the item is counted as low-coverage, never silently
  dropped.
- >-
  A mid-size LLM answers concrete sentence-vs-specialized-sentence entailment questions reliably enough (target at least 85%
  on monotonicity NLI benchmarks such as MED/HELP, including downward contexts). Feasibility probe: gemini-2.5-flash got 9/10
  and gpt-4.1-mini 8/10 on hand-built legal and generic items; flash-lite got 4/10, with the classic downward failures.
- >-
  Semantic monotonicity and slot anchoring, checked over finite structures of size 1–3 (or 1–4), agree with the unbounded
  notions for the short-to-medium formulas in FOLIO, MALLS and ProverQA. Unknown or timeout results are reported as coverage
  loss.
- >-
  A large share of real NL→FOL errors (negation, quantifier, implication direction, dropped or added conditions, argument
  swaps, conflation or splitting) change the signature. Pure scope permutations and numeric errors do not, and are predicted
  blind spots.
- >-
  Prover-checked equivalence to corrected gold, plus adjudication of a stratified sample of non-equivalent candidates, gives
  labels good enough to estimate item-level correctness. The residual bias from wrong gold and correct-but-inequivalent candidates
  can be estimated and reported.
investigation_approach: |-
  STEP 1 — Build the metric as reusable Python functions.
    - formula_signature(fol): parse FOLIO/MALLS/ProverQA syntax (and user-pilot syntax; non-FOL constructs such as '⊆' between variables count as unparseable) into z3 over EnumSorts of size 1..N. Return per-predicate labels {+, −, 0 vacuous, ± non-monotone} and slot anchors. The prototype is in feasibility/: 12 formulas in 0.4 s, 4 anchoring checks in 0.3 s.
    - text_signature(text): extract content concepts (spaCy noun/verb/adjective heads plus multiword chunks). Build specialized variants with neutral restrictive modifiers. Batch up-probes and down-probes into one call to a mid-size OpenRouter model. Use the two directions as a built-in consistency check. Extract roles from a UD parse (nsubj/obj/obl). Also build a zero-LLM variant with a rule-based UD polarity marker (Udep2Mono-style).
    - align(text_concepts, predicates): lemma and camel-case split overlap, with a MiniLM embedding fallback.
    - signature_score(text, fol) → score in [0,1] plus error-type flags, coverage and cost.
    - document_signature(sentences, fols): cross-sentence alignment consistency; flags conflation when one predicate aligns to concepts with incompatible signatures across sentences.
  STEP 2 — Meta-evaluation set.
    - (a) Sentences: FOLIO (v2) with the corrected gold released by arXiv:2606.02837, MALLS-v0 test (1k) with corrected gold where available, and ProverQA (clean, synthetic gold). About 800–1,000 sentences, stratified by complexity: length, number of quantifiers, nesting depth, number of conditions/exceptions.
    - (b) Real candidates from 6 systems of different families and sizes, called through OpenRouter (for example Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Mistral-Small, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5-flash, DeepSeek-V3), plus any released system outputs (for example Logic-LM/LINC FOLIO outputs). k=5 samples each for the self-consistency baseline.
    - (c) Labels: z3 equivalence to corrected gold, both bounded and unbounded, allowing a predicate-renaming bijection search. Granularity-aware equivalence defines compound predicates as conjunctions of gold predicates when names align. A stratified sample of non-equivalent candidates is adjudicated by a 3-model frontier panel plus author spot checks. This estimates the correct-but-inequivalent rate, and the original-vs-corrected gold diff estimates the wrong-gold rate. Correctness is reported under both labelings to show the label bias.
    - (d) Controlled perturbations of corrected gold: typed mutation operators (negation insert/remove, ∀↔∃, implication reversal, drop or add conjunct, argument swap, scope swap, predicate merge/split, cardinality change). Keep only mutants the prover confirms are not equivalent to gold.
    - (e) Meaning-preserving rewrites: variable and predicate renaming (synonyms), conjunct reordering, contrapositive, De Morgan, prenexing, quantifier distribution. All are solver-verified equivalent.
  STEP 3 — Baselines, all on the same items:
    - parse/compile rate;
    - round-trip FOL→NL→(embedding similarity, NLI);
    - LLM-as-judge (a cheap model on all items, a frontier model on a subset to test whether it earns its cost);
    - sampling self-consistency (share of the k samples prover-equivalent to the candidate);
    - the user's structural metrics (arity consistency, undefined predicates, predicate-set Jaccard across reruns, joint-load conflicts), ported from the pilot code.
  STEP 4 — Analyses:
    - item-level AUROC and Spearman against correctness;
    - system-level Kendall τ against system accuracy;
    - per-error-type detection rate and error-type identification (confusion matrix);
    - false-alarm rate on meaning-preserving rewrites;
    - coverage, with unparseable items counted;
    - cost in $ and seconds per item;
    - reliability per complexity stratum, testing the predicted crossover against the LLM judge;
    - incremental signal: logistic regression of correctness on baselines ± signature, bootstrap ΔAUROC CIs;
    - text-side oracle accuracy on MED/HELP;
    - gold-error detection: precision@k of text-vs-gold signature mismatches against the corrected-label diffs;
    - contamination check for the LLM-based metrics: each LLM metric is run on original FOLIO/MALLS sentences and on verified paraphrases with renamed entities, and a gold-recall probe is run. Because the signature's LLM never sees any formula, it is predicted to show no paraphrase drop, while the judge may.
    - Qualitative transfer: run on the user's EU-AI-Act pilot outputs to show the error-type distribution; there is no gold there, so no accuracy claim.
  BUDGET (≈$6–7 of $10):
    - text probes (~1k sentences × ~8 concepts × 2 directions, batched): ≈$1;
    - candidate generation: ≈$1.5–2;
    - LLM-judge plus round-trip baselines: ≈$3;
    - adjudication and contamination checks: ≈$1.
    The solver side is CPU-only, well under a second per formula.
success_criteria: |-
  CONFIRM if all of the following hold:
  - (1) Controlled perturbations: detection is at least 0.90 for negation, ∀/∃, implication reversal, dropped or added condition and argument swap. Macro error-type identification is at least 0.70. Detection is near chance for pure scope swaps and cardinality changes. That last result is the predicted blind spot and confirms the mechanism rather than counting as a failure.
  - (2) Meaning-preserving rewrites: false-alarm rate is at most 5%. The formula side is invariant by construction, so any false alarms come from alignment and are reported separately.
  - (3) Real candidates: item-level AUROC is at least 0.75 against prover-plus-adjudication labels. Adding the signature to the best baseline combination improves AUROC with a bootstrap 95% CI above 0. System-level Kendall τ is at least 0.6.
  - (4) In the top complexity tercile (most conditions/exceptions), signature AUROC is at least that of the cheap LLM judge, and the gap grows with the number of conditions (the crossover).
  - (5) At least 80% of adjudicated correct-but-gold-inequivalent candidates get a full signature match, where gold-equivalence gives them 0.
  - (6) Gold-error flagging reaches precision@50 at least 2× the base rate against the corrected-label diffs.
  DISCONFIRM if real-candidate AUROC is below 0.65 or the signature adds no increment over the baselines. In that case, the text-oracle accuracy on MED/HELP (probe below 80% means the text side is the bottleneck) and the alignment coverage decide which half of the bridge failed. Both are reported as negative results.
  A result where detection is strong on perturbations but weak on real candidates would show that real errors are mostly scope and cardinality errors. That is itself a finding about what NL→FOL systems get wrong.
related_works:
- >-
  Faithful Autoformalization via Roundtrip Verification and Repair (arXiv:2604.25031): gold-free formalize→back-translate→re-formalize→equivalence
  check. It compares whole formulas through an LLM round trip; the proposal never back-translates, and compares a solver-computed
  semantic invariant with a text-side substitution probe, one concept at a time.
- >-
  Monty, Faithful Autoformalization of NL Assertions (arXiv:2607.13303): an LLM back-translates the assertion and scores bidirectional

  and slot anchoring, which is equivalence-invariant and names the error type.
- >-
  LLMCodeChoice / Oracle-guided program selection (ISSTA 2024), DPC with Minimal Distinguishing Databases (arXiv:2604.15163,
  ACL 2026), and Cunha & Macedo, LLM-generated Alloy test cases (arXiv:2510.23350): distinguishing inputs judged by an LLM
  against the NL spec. Porting this to FOL was considered and abandoned as the main idea (kept as Alternate 1). The proposal
  needs no distinguishing models and no candidate set.
- >-
  Semantic Evaluation for Text-to-SQL with Distilled Test Suites (Zhong et al., EMNLP 2020) and SpotIt (arXiv:2510.26840):
  denotation and verification comparisons that need a gold query. The proposal is gold-free.
- >-
  Entailment-Preserving FOL representations, EPR metrics (Lee et al., ACL 2025): a reference-free metric that needs multi-premise
  NLI data with entailment labels. The proposal works on any single sentence with no labels.
- >-
  Assessing the Sensitivity and Alignment of FOL Closeness Metrics (Thatikonda et al., EMNLP Findings 2025): perturbation
  sensitivity of gold-based metrics (BLEU, Smatch, LE) and their alignment with LLM judges. That work concerns gold-based
  closeness; the proposal is gold-free and reuses its typed-perturbation idea only as an instrument.
- >-
  Symbolic-equivalence sampling consistency (arXiv:2410.20936), Grammars of Formal Uncertainty (NeurIPS 2025), CLOVER (ICLR
  2025, SAT-based selection among translations): these measure agreement within a generator's distribution, not agreement
  with the text. They are used as the self-consistency baseline.
- >-
  Natural-logic polarity marking (van Benthem; Sánchez-Valencia; Hu & Moss 2018; Udep2Mono, Chen & Gao IWCS 2021) and monotonicity
  NLI datasets MED/HELP (Yanaka et al. 2019): polarity machinery built for NLI. Nobody has used it as a text↔formula faithfulness
  bridge. The proposal borrows it as the text-side instrument and uses MED/HELP to validate the oracle independently.
- >-
  Kupferman & Vardi vacuity detection (model checking): a subformula that does not affect truth indicates a specification
  bug. It is borrowed as the '0' label of the signature (vacuous or added condition) and not claimed as new.
- >-
  Relabeling FOLIO/MALLS (arXiv:2606.02837, EMNLP 2026): about 39%/36% wrong gold, with corrected labels released. The proposal
  uses those labels to build ground truth and, in the other direction, to test whether signature mismatches flag wrong gold
  without any reference.
- >-
  FormalRx-CC (ICML 2026): Lean witnesses that separate a candidate from an intended formalization. It requires the intended
  formalization; the proposal does not.
inspiration: >-
  Formal semantics and psycholinguistics: the monotonicity calculus (van Benthem, Sánchez-Valencia) and generalized-quantifier
  theory (Barwise & Cooper) say that determiners, negation and conditionals fix the entailment direction of every argument
  position. Speakers mark this overtly and FOL fixes it exactly. Model checking (vacuity detection, Kupferman & Vardi) supplied
  the idea of asking a solver whether each atomic piece of a specification actually matters and in which direction. Measurement
  theory supplied the move of measuring both sides with the same operation (a subset-substitution experiment), so the two
  measurements are commensurable without any shared vocabulary: the solver runs it on the formula, a behavioural entailment
  probe runs it on the sentence. This is like calibrating two instruments against one physical intervention rather than against
  each other's readouts. The design deliberately avoids the default 'LLM compares formula to text' move, which every occupied
  gold-free method uses.
terms:
- term: Monotonicity (upward/downward)
  definition: >-
    A sentence or formula is upward-monotone in a concept if replacing that concept with a more general one (a superset) keeps
    it true. It is downward-monotone if replacing it with a more specific one (a subset) keeps it true. Example: in 'All dogs
    bark', 'dogs' is downward (all brown dogs bark follows) and 'bark' is upward (all dogs make noise follows).
- term: Monotonicity signature
  definition: >-
    The per-concept labels + (upward), − (downward), 0 (vacuous: truth does not depend on it), ± (neither), together with
    the role anchors of each relation. It is computed once for the sentence and once for the formula.
- term: Role anchoring
  definition: >-
    Slot i of relation R is anchored to concept A if restricting R to tuples whose i-th argument is an A never changes the
    formula's truth. For example, in 'every student reads some book', slot 0 of Reads is anchored to Student. Swapped arguments
    swap the anchors.
- term: Semantic (solver-checked) monotonicity
  definition: >-
    Monotonicity of formula F in predicate P, decided by checking that P ⊆ P' ∧ F(P) ∧ ¬F(P') (upward) or P ⊆ P' ∧ F(P') ∧
    ¬F(P) (downward) has no model, here over all finite structures up to a small size. It is a property of F's meaning, so
    equivalent formulas get the same label.
- term: Substitution probe
  definition: >-
    The text-side measurement: ask a mid-size LLM whether the sentence entails a copy with one concept specialized (and the
    reverse). The LLM never sees a formula.
- term: Vacuity
  definition: >-
    A predicate or subformula whose presence does not affect the formula's truth value. It signals an added or ineffective
    condition.
- term: Correct-but-gold-inequivalent
  definition: >-
    A candidate that faithfully formalizes the sentence but is not prover-equivalent to the gold formula because of different
    vocabulary or granularity. Gold-equivalence labels count it as wrong.
- term: Crossover (complexity)
  definition: >-
    The predicted point where, as the number of conditions and exceptions grows, the signature metric's accuracy overtakes
    the LLM-as-judge's.
summary: >-
  Score an NL→FOL output by checking that sentence and formula 'generalize the same way'. For every concept, a solver decides
  exactly whether the formula is upward-monotone, downward-monotone, vacuous or non-monotone in it, and which concept anchors
  each relation slot. A formula-blind entailment probe measures the same properties on the sentence. The mismatch gives a
  gold-free, equivalence- and renaming-invariant faithfulness score that names the error type, and it is predicted to beat
  LLM judges on long, heavily conditioned sentences while being provably blind to pure scope errors.
alternates:
- title: Solver-chosen truth-value judgment scenarios
  hypothesis: >-
    Faithfulness can be predicted by generating, with a solver, small concrete worlds that separate the candidate from each
    of its typed single-edit mutants. Each world is verbalized as a closed list of facts, and a cheap LLM is asked only whether
    the original SENTENCE is true in that world (the truth-value-judgment task from child-language research). The candidate's
    score is how often the judged truth values agree with the candidate rather than with its mutants. The mutant family that
    wins names the error type.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    Unlike the monotonicity signature, it can see quantifier-scope and cardinality errors, and it needs no concept-to-predicate
    alignment. It wins if LLMs judge truth in explicit small worlds much more reliably than they compare formulas, and if
    scope errors turn out to dominate real NL→FOL failures. Caveat: the core mechanism (distinguishing inputs judged by an
    LLM oracle) already exists for code and SQL (LLMCodeChoice, DPC), so its novelty is lower.
- title: Diagnostic-test latent-class estimation across systems
  hypothesis: >-
    Without gold, per-item correctness can be estimated by treating the outputs of several heterogeneous NL→FOL systems, and
    the benchmark gold itself, as imperfect diagnostic tests. Each output is grouped into solver-equivalence classes after
    vocabulary alignment. A Hui–Walter / Dawid–Skene latent-class model, as used in epidemiology to evaluate tests with no
    gold standard, then estimates each output's posterior probability of being correct, along with each system's and the gold's
    error rates.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It uses a different body of evidence (cross-system agreement, corrected for correlated errors) instead of text-side probes,
    and it directly estimates how often gold is wrong. It wins if system families make errors that are close enough to conditionally
    independent, and if several systems are available per sentence. It then catches errors that preserve the signature, such
    as scope errors.
- title: Prover-derived instance consequences checked by small NLI
  hypothesis: >-
    A faithful formula's concrete consequences must follow from the text. The prover derives ground consequences and non-consequences
    of the candidate for named individuals (e.g., 'Rex is a dog and is not trained, so Rex barks'; 'Alice and Bob are students;
    they need not read the same book'), verbalized from templates. A CPU cross-encoder NLI model (DeBERTa-v3-MNLI) checks
    whether each follows from the sentence. The entailment agreement rate is the score, and the consequence type that fails
    names the error.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It needs no LLM calls at all (lowest cost), and instance-level reasoning avoids NLI models' known weakness on downward-monotone
    quantified inferences. It can also expose scope errors through multi-individual instances. It wins if small NLI models
    are accurate on template instance entailments and if the verbalization of predicate names reads naturally.

<strategy_domain_reasoning>
How the strategist established that researchers in this field reason, at the level of the field's principles and standards of evidence. Take it as the starting point for the concrete practice below — extend or correct it where your own reading disagrees, and say so when you do.

FIELD: evaluation of neuro-symbolic NL->FOL autoformalization. It borrows semantic-parsing meta-evaluation norms (test-suite / denotation accuracy, Zhong et al. 2020), formal semantics (natural-logic monotonicity) and model checking (vacuity, distinguishing models). Read: the aii neuro-symbolic handbook (mid-2026), the relabelling paper arXiv:2606.02837 and its HF release (DSAVlab-UNIUD), and this run's own iter-1 artifacts (two screen arms plus the labelled held-out dataset).

(1) PRINCIPLES. NL->FOL output is not unique, so correctness is semantic: prover or solver equivalence, never string match. Canonical gold is known to be broken. arXiv:2606.02837 reports about 40% wrong FOLIO/MALLS gold, and this run's panel measured MALLS 45.6%, FOLIO-train 62% and ProverQA 17.5% wrong gold. Iter 1 added a sharper point that the field states only loosely: gold-equivalence labels are themselves biased. 43.9% [39.5, 48.6] of solver-non-equivalent candidates are faithful by adjudication, and solver labels agree with the adjudicated labels only 67.6% of the time. A meta-evaluation that uses solver-equivalence labels as the target is therefore measuring 'agrees with gold's vocabulary', not faithfulness. Still argued: what a gold-free faithfulness number must certify to be accepted (handbook Open Question 3); no metric is agreed.

(2) WHAT COUNTS AS CONVINCING. The field is persuaded by an item-level AUROC and a system-level rank correlation on HELD-OUT real system outputs that are labelled independently of the metric. These must be compared on identical items against the gold-free methods already in the lane: LLM-as-judge, round-trip (arXiv:2604.25031), Monty conformance (arXiv:2607.13303) and sampling self-consistency. The confirmation has to be frozen before labels are seen: a screen winner re-scored on its own screen is not evidence. Typed perturbations count as mechanism evidence only (Thatikonda et al., EMNLP-F 2025). A blind spot predicted in advance that then appears on real errors is unusually persuasive.

(3) STANDARD MOVES AND WHY.
- Equivalence up to predicate renaming rules out penalising vocabulary.
- Adjudicated or corrected labels rule out scoring annotation noise.
- A label source from a family disjoint from both metric and generators rules out circular agreement.
- The sentence-clustered bootstrap rules out treating 9 outputs of one sentence as 9 independent draws.
- Post-stratified weights rule out the oversampling in the adjudication design biasing the AUROC.
- Paraphrase/entity-renaming contamination probes rule out judges recalling public gold.
- Complexity-stratified reporting rules out averages that hide failure on long, conditioned sentences.
- Frozen hyperparameters and thresholds rule out tuning on the confirmation set.

(4) USUAL FAILURE MODES.
- Labels that share machinery with the metric. Here the latent-class score clusters outputs with the SAME bijection-equivalence checker that produced the screen labels. The iter-1 report already showed it drops .849 -> .772 when gold is swapped.
- Measuring perturbation detection and calling it faithfulness.
- Silently dropping unparseable outputs.
- Absolute-threshold false-alarm definitions that mostly measure judge noise (iter-1 TVJT: 42% 'false alarms' even on pure conjunct reorders).
- Untuned or single-sample LLM judges. gemini-2.5-flash at T=0 was shown to be non-deterministic across concurrent calls.
- Developing a repair on the confirmation set.
- Saturation: short FOLIO sentences hide the regime (long, conditioned) the user cares about.

<domain_practice>
FIRST WORK OUT HOW THIS KIND OF STUDY IS ACTUALLY BUILT IN THIS FIELD. Then
write the plan.

The strategy already settled what the field believes and what it counts as
convincing. Your job is the level below that: how work of exactly this kind
is designed, run and reported by the people who do it, concretely enough that
the executor's output would be recognised as competent by one of them.

Establish, for this field and this artifact type:

- BASELINES AND COMPARISONS. Which comparisons appear in every paper of this
  kind, named specifically. Which one would a reviewer name first if it were
  missing, and what is the standard way of tuning it fairly?
- CASES AND DATA. Which datasets, corpora, cohorts, benchmarks, case sets or
  sources are standard here, and which are known to be saturated, leaked,
  deprecated or unrepresentative. Prefer the ones the field actually uses,
  and say why when you pick something else.
- CONTROLS AND WHAT IS HELD CONSTANT. What has to be held fixed for the
  comparison to mean anything, and which confound this design is most likely
  to be caught on.
- HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH. Sample sizes, item counts, seeds, repeats, splits —
  the number below which nobody in this field believes a result, and what the
  field reports alongside a point estimate (variance, intervals, a
  significance or uncertainty treatment). When a power analysis, or the
  effect sizes already on record, say the panel cannot detect the size of
  effect the plan is chasing, the fix is more graded samples or checkpoints
  — not more candidate metrics. An underpowered panel stays underpowered no
  matter how many readouts run over it.
- MEASURES AND REPORTING CONVENTIONS. Which measures are standard, how they
  are computed here, and the conventions a reader will expect to see — what
  is reported, against what, in what form.

Not every axis applies to every artifact type: a proof has proof standards
and an accepted level of rigour rather than sample sizes, a research artifact
has source quality and coverage, a dataset has provenance, licensing and
documentation norms. Answer the ones that apply and skip the ones that do not
rather than inventing content for them.

HOW MUCH EFFORT. Bounded, like the strategist's: the fitting domain handbook
plus a handful of targeted lookups — one or two recent papers doing this exact
kind of study, a benchmark or dataset card, a methods or reproducibility note.
Read what the field does; do not reason it out from first principles. You
cannot run code, so this is reading only.

THEN CHECK THE PLAN AGAINST IT.
- `domain_practice`: what you established above, concretely — named baselines,
  named data, the numbers, the measures, with what you read.
- `practice_alignment`: go through the plan you just wrote against that list
  and say, point by point, where it MEETS the field's practice and where it
  DEPARTS from it. For every departure: why it is justified here (budget,
  scope, the claim being narrower) and what it costs the result's
  credibility. A departure nobody named is the one a reviewer finds.
- Where the check exposes a gap you can close inside the budget, close it in
  the plan rather than reporting it. `practice_alignment` is for what remains
  after you have fixed what you can.

objective: |-
  THE MONOTONICITY SIGNATURE AS A ZERO-LLM ERROR-TYPE DIAGNOSER AND WRONG-GOLD FLAGGER (the main hypothesis, sideways to where it can be positive). Fix its two diagnosed defects on the screen only: renaming-sensitive alignment, and the weak text-side polarity. Freeze it. Then validate on held-out real outputs:
  (i) error-type naming against the panel's adjudicated error types, compared with an LLM asked to name the type;
  (ii) the pre-registered blind spots (scope, cardinality, and/or) on REAL errors;
  (iii) gold-free flagging of wrong benchmark gold against panel audits and the 99 human corrections;
  (iv) whether polarity adds signal beyond alignment coverage once the text side is repaired.
approach: |-
  CODE/DATA REUSE: the iter-1 screen experiments (Arm A = art_WABUmpThXw7N, Arm B = art_n0DrABr4tqyb) cannot be listed as formal dependencies, because experiments may depend only on datasets. Read their files READ-ONLY by absolute path and copy what you need into your own workspace.
  - Arm A: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_qY2a2IS-WLIs/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_1 (method.py, src/, data/screen_set.json, results/screen_scores.jsonl, results/text_sigs.json).
  - Arm B: /ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_qY2a2IS-WLIs/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_2 (src/metrics_api.py, src/tvjt.py, src/mutants.py, src/verbalize.py, src/fol_core.py, src/latent_class.py, src/llm.py, data/screen_set.json, data/worlds_cache.jsonl, data/blindspot_supplement.jsonl, results/screen_scores.jsonl).
  If a path is unreadable, re-implement from the description in this approach and log the deviation.

  BASE: iter-1 Arm A method.py, signature_faithfulness(text, fol, variant A0/A1/A2/A3), reused by path. It includes the propositional-grounding z3 signature (2,645 signatures in 19 s), the rule-based UD polarity marker (MED downward .86), the gemini probe (downward .60), and the lemma/camelCase + MiniLM aligner.

  PHASE 1: REPAIR ON THE SCREEN AND MED/HELP ONLY, then freeze.
  - (R1) Renaming-robust alignment. In iter 1 all G2 failures came from SYN_RENAME (38-42%); logical rewrites were 0/270. Replace greedy lemma matching with a global assignment (Hungarian) over a concept x predicate similarity. The similarity is the max of: lemma/camelCase overlap, WordNet synset/hypernym path similarity, and MiniLM cosine of the predicate's split words vs the concept phrase. Add an arity/slot constraint from the UD roles. The similarity must NOT use any polarity information, to avoid circularity. Target: screen SYN_RENAME FA <= 5% while mutant detection for NEG, forall/exists, IMPL, DROP, ADD and ARGSWAP does not drop by more than 0.03.
  - (R2) Text side. On a MED/HELP DEV split only, pick the best of:
    - the rule marker;
    - rule marker + gemini-2.5-flash probe, with an up/down consistency vote;
    - a stronger probe model (for example gpt-4.1 or gemini-2.5-pro) on downward contexts only, if cost allows.
    Report MED/HELP TEST accuracy by up/down for the frozen choice.
  - (R3) Error-type decoder. Map the signature mismatch vector to the 8-type taxonomy with the hypothesis's table, plus 'no-signature-change' -> {scope, cardinality, and/or, constant} as the predicted blind-spot bucket. Calibrate its tie-breaking on screen MUTANTS only (known types).
  Write frozen_config.json before touching held-out labels.

  PHASE 2: HELD-OUT VALIDATION (dataset art_iyzYyaqlqpSX).
  - (V1) ERROR-TYPE NAMING on the panel3 items judged unfaithful, using metadata_L3_primary_error and the per-member error_types in L3_votes: top-1 and top-2 accuracy, macro-F1 and the confusion matrix, weighted by post-stratification. The baseline is gemini-2.5-flash, shown sentence + candidate and asked to pick one type from the same taxonomy (the typed-judge baseline). Report also the agreement with the panel's inter-member type agreement as a ceiling. Report per type: added/dropped condition and forall/exists are 61% of real errors and are where the signature should be strongest.
  - (V2) BLIND SPOTS ON REAL ERRORS: the per-real-type detection rate, P(signature score of the erroneous candidate < the score of a faithful candidate of the same sentence). Prediction: >= 0.8 for added/dropped/forall-exists/negation/argument swap; ≈ 0.5 for quantifier_scope, cardinality_numeric and connective_and_or. Include the iter-1 blind-spot supplement.
  - (V3) WRONG-GOLD FLAGGING. Run the signature text-vs-GOLD on every held-out gold (about 700) and the 1,003-row screen gold audit. The target is the panel gold verdict (metadata_gold_faithful_final); additionally, on the 99 MALLS golds with human corrections, the paper-corrected flag. Report:
    - AUROC;
    - precision@25/@50 vs base rate, per corpus. Base rates are ProverQA 17.5% (restrictor-dropping golds should surface as 'dropped condition'), MALLS 45.6% and FOLIO-train 62%;
    - the predicted error type of each flagged gold against the panel's gold primary_error.
    Baseline: B1 judge applied to the gold.
  - (V4) POLARITY INCREMENT. On panel items compute the cross-fitted delta-AUROC of [B1 + parse + A0 alignment-only] + repaired polarity signature, frozen vs iter-1 A3. This settles whether the repaired text side makes polarity, not alignment, carry signal. Also report the complexity-tercile AUROC.
  - (V5) DOCUMENT-LEVEL CONFLATION (document_signature). On FOLIO-train stories (several sentences per story in heldout_confirm), flag a predicate aligned to concepts with incompatible signatures across sentences. Test against panel conflation / wrong_split labels where present. This is exploratory; label it so.
  - (V6) TRANSFER: the error-type distribution on the 289 parseable EU-AI-Act pilot formulas (transfer_unlabeled), compared with the held-out real error mix. No accuracy claim.

  Deliverable: a cleaned reusable module with signature_faithfulness(text, fol) -> {score, error_types, coverage, per_concept_signs}, gold_audit(text, gold_fol) and document_signature(sentences, fols), each with a precise statement of what it measures.

  BUDGET: <= $6.
  - Text probes for about 1.1k sentences: about $1.
  - Typed-judge baseline plus B1 on panel items and golds: about $1.5.
  - Stronger downward probe: <= $2.
  Formula side and alignment are CPU-only.

title: Screening solver-based faithfulness scores for logic translations
summary: >-
  Arm A of the iter-1 NL->FOL faithfulness screen (run_qY2a2IS-WLIs). PROVIDES: (1) data/screen_set.json, the frozen meta-evaluation
  set built with the recipe shared with Arm B: 300 sha1-first FOLIO-dev sentences and 835 Logic-LM real candidates (gpt-3.5-turbo
  265, gpt-4 298, davinci-003 272). Each has blind bijection-equivalence labels (389 equiv, 0 unlabeled; bounded and unbounded
  z3 agree 389/389), plus labels against FOLIO v0.0 gold and lexical-bijection labels. The curated 2606.02837 gold is HF DSAVlab-UNIUD/FOLIO_validation-curated,
  matched on 97 sentences, 52% of which were corrected. There are 1375 solver-verified mutants (9 operators; SCOPE has 0)
  and 412 equivalent rewrites; data/screen_set_ids.txt is for Arm B. (2) method.py, the reusable API signature_faithfulness(text,
  fol, variant A1/A2/A3/A0/Ccov) and the pipeline. (3) Results in method_out.json (validated, exp_gen_sol_out) and results/summary.json.
  AUROC [clustered 95% CI]: A1 0.711 [0.663,0.756], A2 0.711, A3 (zero-LLM rules) 0.718 [0.673,0.763], B1 gemini judge 0.644,
  B3nli round-trip 0.660, B4 decomposed LLM judge 0.715, B5 oracle 0.741, B7 structural 0.537, B8 self-consistency 0.608,
  and the controls A0 (alignment-only) 0.674 and Ccov 0.661. G3 increment over judge+parse is A1 +0.084 [0.037,0.138] and
  A3 +0.093 [0.048,0.143]. VERDICT (pre-registered rule): NO survivor. Every candidate fails G2, with 13-14% false alarms,
  all from synonym-renamed rewrites (38-42%); logical rewrites give 0/270. A3 advances by the no-survivor clause. DIAGNOSIS:
  the text side is the bottleneck (LLM probe MED downward accuracy 0.60; rule marker 0.86). Exact semantics roughly equals
  LLM decomposition (A1-B4 -0.005 [-0.024,0.014]). Much of the signal is lexical alignment: the polarity increment over [B1,
  parse, A0] is not significant (A1 +0.013, A3 +0.024, CIs include 0). Every metric is near chance in the TOP complexity tercile
  (A1 0.507, B1 0.533), so there is no crossover. Blind spots CARD and ANDOR are confirmed (0.50), and A2 does not fix ANDOR.
  Spend was $5.67; B1+ was skipped for budget. The headline numbers were independently re-derived (audit_rederive.py) and
  the placebos fail as expected.

  mismatches; v1 vs curated gold differ on 43/108 (6 semantic). FOLIO-dev has 0 mixed-quantifier golds, so SCOPE_SWAP is covered
  only by a FOLIO-train/MALLS supplement (TVJT 0.65, n=37; NLI 0.47). Also found: Arm A zips misaligned premise lists (stories

<build_on_prior_work>
BUILD ON WHAT THE EARLIER ROUNDS ALREADY PRODUCED. That is the default, not an option.

<prior_work> lists what this run has already built. Before planning anything
from scratch, go through it and find what this artifact can stand on:
- data that is already collected, cleaned, split or labelled
- models, fits, checkpoints or indexes that are already trained or built
- harnesses, scripts and evaluation code that already run
- the findings themselves, the NEGATIVE ones included — a condition already
  ruled out is a result to build past, not ground to cover again

Then say in `builds_on`, concretely, what this plan reuses: which artifact,
which file, from where. The executor gets a dependency's files only through
the direction's declared dependencies, so when the plan leans on an artifact
that is not among them, say in the plan where the executor picks it up
(workspace path, output file) and keep the plan runnable if it is missing.

STARTING A FRESH LINE is allowed on exactly two grounds:
1. The iteration's move is a WIDEN — the run deliberately went back to the
   original ask to screen different candidate answers, so a new line is the
   point of the round.
2. The line this would have continued is a SETTLED NEGATIVE — already tested
   well enough that pushing it further buys nothing.
On either ground, `builds_on` says which one it is and why, and still names
whatever infrastructure (data, harness, code) the new line can reuse.

"Cleaner to start over" is not one of the two grounds. Neither is a plan that
simply does not mention the earlier rounds.
</build_on_prior_work>

<own_your_inputs>
A STEP THIS PLAN COMMISSIONS MUST HAVE ITS INPUTS OWNED BY SOMETHING SCHEDULED.

If this plan pre-registers a later phase — a held-out confirmation, a blind
set, a second pass, a replication — that phase needs inputs of its own:
labels, ground truth, an annotation pass, a scored reference. Before writing
that phase into the plan, name what produces those inputs and where that
production is scheduled: inside this artifact's own steps, or as one of the
direction's declared dependencies. Say it concretely, not "labels will be
added" — which task, at which point in the plan.

A later step whose inputs nobody is scheduled to produce is not a plan for
that step, it is a plan to skip it while looking like it was included.
</own_your_inputs>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu_basic: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_plus: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

IMPORTANT: this task is NOT complete until `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` exists and contains JSON matching the schema above.

I work on converting natural-language text into first-order logic (NL→FOL, autoformalization) with
LLM pipelines. Evaluation is the bottleneck. Correct FOL for a sentence is not unique — different
predicate names, different decompositions of the same concept, and logically equivalent rewrites can
all be correct. Gold FOL annotations are rare and expensive. The metrics in use either need a gold
formula (exact match, BLEU, prover-checked equivalence to the gold) or only check that the output
parses. In my own pilot I used cheap structural metrics: whether a set of generated formulas loads
together without conflicts, whether predicate arities stay consistent, how many predicates are used
but never defined, and how similar the predicate sets are across reruns. Those measure stability and
composability, not whether a formula says what the sentence says.

Find new metrics for NL→FOL output quality. Operating situation: you are given a natural-language
sentence (or short passage) and a candidate FOL formalization produced by any system. There is no gold
formula, no ontology or controlled vocabulary, and no domain knowledge. The metric returns a score
that predicts whether the formalization is faithful to the text, and ideally which kind of error it
contains (quantifier or scope error, dropped or added condition, negation/polarity error, swapped
arguments, conflated or wrongly split concepts). Metrics may score a single formula or a set (several
samples for one sentence, or the formalizations of all sentences in one document). They must be
task-agnostic — usable for any NL→FOL setting, not tied to a domain, dataset or pipeline — and cheap
enough to run on every output (solver calls and small models are fine; a large-LLM judge per formula
only if shown to earn its cost).

Requirements:
- Keep the target fixed: the metric must predict faithfulness to the text. Detecting synthetic
  perturbations, parse validity, or run-to-run stability are not substitutes for that target.
- Validate against ground truth, never against the metric itself. Use public datasets with gold
  sentence-level FOL (e.g. FOLIO, MALLS, or others you find) to build a meta-evaluation set: real
  candidate formalizations from several different systems, plus controlled perturbations of gold
  formulas with known error types, labelled via prover-checked equivalence to gold. Handle two known
  problems: some gold annotations are wrong, and a candidate can be correct without being equivalent
  to the gold (different vocabulary or granularity). Estimate how often each happens and how it
  biases the labels. These datasets are public, so check whether LLM-based metrics benefit from having
  seen the gold.
- For each metric report: correlation with correctness at item and system level; sensitivity per error
  type; invariance under meaning-preserving rewrites (variable/predicate renaming, reordering,
  equivalent restatements); coverage — unparseable outputs are counted and reported, never silently
  dropped; and cost.
- Compare against baselines: parse/compile rate, round-trip (FOL→NL→compare) similarity,
  LLM-as-judge, sampling self-consistency, and the structural consistency metrics described above. A
  new metric matters only if it adds signal those don't.
- Report how each metric's reliability changes with sentence complexity (length, number of quantifiers,
  nesting depth, number of conditions and exceptions). Long, heavily conditioned sentences matter most
  to me.
- Negative results are welcome: if a family of metrics does not track correctness, show that clearly.

Out of scope: comparing grounded vs ungrounded generation (ontology vocabulary injected into prompts),
anything that depends on a particular ontology, and building a better NL→FOL translator. The
contribution is the measurement, not the translator.

Deliverables: reusable Python functions taking (text, fol) — or a set of such pairs — each with a
precise statement of what it measures; the meta-evaluation dataset with its labels; and the results.

I appended the a full pilot study using the metrics I already had in the zip for reference.

# Neuro-symbolic AI — field handbook (mid-2026)

## Overview
The SUBSTRATE below is the star: a dense, grounded map of the field as of mid-2026 — organizing principles, a theme-balanced frontier, and an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is OPEN QUESTIONS (tensions the reader resolves their own way; no prescribed directions), then a thin execution floor. Every claim resolves to a verbatim quote in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md).

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)
- **No settled integration recipe.** ["To date, no single predominant approach exists"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI) [S2]. The shared design-space map is Kautz's coupling taxonomy; the text2logic pattern is type 3 — a ["neural architecture to interpret perceptual data as symbols and relationships that are further reasoned about symbolically"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI) [S2].
- **Verification is entering BOTH inference and training.** The 2024–2026 through-line: techniques ["that increasingly connect generation with verification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.08728) [S12] — verification is no longer a post-hoc add-on.
- **Deep work is judged on principled integration serving trust.** The durable framing centers ["trust, safety, interpretability and accountability"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05876) [S4]; the 2024 systematic review (1,428→167 papers) finds ["Explainability and trustworthiness are less represented (28%), with meta-cognition being the least explored area (5%)"](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.05435v1) [S1].
- **The stated scale bottleneck is knowledge acquisition, not inference:** ["knowledge extraction is the main bottleneck"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI) computationally at large scale [S2].
- **The field now applies a correction rule to its own headlines:** ["high compilation rates or accuracies should not be equated with faithful reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.19459) [S6][S5] — accuracy gains no longer certify the reasoning behind them.

## Frontier (2025 H2 – 2026 H1, recency-weighted, theme-balanced)

**Text→logic / autoformalization.**
- Scale is not the lever for NL→FOL: ["Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT reasoning ability"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22338); ["predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22338) — the predicate list, not model size, is the lever [S8] (2025-09).
- **Wedge now OCCUPIED (rank it down):** gold-free certification of autoformalization exists — ["We propose a roundtrip verification approach which does not require ground-truth annotations: formalize a statement, translate the result back to natural language, re-formalize, and use a formal tool to check logical equivalence."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.25031) [S9] (2026-04, SMT-community authors). Proposing gold-free roundtrip certification as novel re-treads this.
- The "LLMs can't do NL→FOL" premise is being walked back — ["recent literature provides contrasting results"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11816), but sentence-level translation is largely handled [S23] (2025-11) → crowded lane 4.

**LLM+solver coupling.**
- The intermediate representation is a live design axis: reframing math reasoning as verifiable code (SymPy) moves failures from opaque fallacies to transparent program errors, ["demonstrating significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over baselines"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25975) [S11] (2025-10).
- Formalize-everything, forward-only pipelines are the diagnosed failure shape — they ["often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03360); the 2025-12 counter-design couples selective, confidence-aware translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning [S20].

**Probabilistic / differentiable NeSy.**
- Normative result, live controversy: the independence assumption (the tractability trick in DeepProbLog/Scallop-style predictors) formally ["entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain concept combinations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11357) [S14] (2025-07).
- Adoption is bottlenecked by tooling, not algorithms: ["A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07122)-solving [S15] (2025-09).

**Benchmarks & eval methodology.**
- Benchmark-validity result: canonical NL→FOL gold is broken — ["approximately 39% and 36% of entries, respectively, contain incorrect FOL formalizations (i.e., ground truth labels)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.02837) in FOLIO and MALLS; corrected labels shift model accuracy +9–22pp, so scores on the originals partly measure annotation noise [S13] (2026-06).
- Eval is shifting from one-gold-proof to multi-path: LogicGraph ships solver-verified instances ["where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21044) [S19] (2026-02).

**Faithfulness / auditable traces** *(hottest thread — deliberately capped here; see crowded list).*
- Formal structure raises accuracy, yet ["this gain does not imply faithful reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16118): scope laundering — reporting solver-inconsistent verdicts without executing the formal reasoning — ["persists across all models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16118) [S5] (2026-06, COLM-2026 under review).
- Baseline-correcting dissent: under UNIFIED generation there is ["no evidence of systematic gaming in unified generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.19459) — ["models prefer reporting failure over forcing proofs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.19459); unfaithfulness surfaces in the TWO-STAGE split and differs by model (axiom fabrication vs premise mistranslation that evades detection) [S6] (2026-04). Reading this paper as "models game formalization" is a documented misreading.
- Per-step trace validation exists: VeriCoT formalizes each CoT step to FOL and types its grounding premise (source / commonsense / prior step); validity ["serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662) [S10] (2025-11).
- Terminology (single 2-author preprint — lead only): ["a formal statement can typecheck and be provable, yet still encode a different theorem than the source intended."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16541) [S7] (2026-06).

**Ontology / KG grounding.**
- **Wedge PARTLY OCCUPIED — and this section's one peer-reviewed anchor:** pretrained NL-term embeddings collide with formal ontology term syntax (SUMO/SUO-KIF), so models ["produce syntactic errors or hallucinate non-existent terms due to conflicting embeddings learned during base training"](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v284/thompson25a.html); a tokenization fix mitigates it [S18] (NeSy 2025, PMLR v284). "Ontology as a faithfulness lever" is no longer blank space.
- Ontology-grounded pipelines are being positioned for high-assurance domains (law/medicine), whose reasoning is ["inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01530) — grounding as an assurance lever, not just background knowledge [S16] (2025-10).

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed)
- **ProverGen/ProverQA** (ICLR 2025): prover-synthesized FOL eval — scalable, contamination-resistant, with ["accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06563); ["state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06563) [S25] (2025-02).
- **NL2FOL** (2024-05): the named key challenge is ["the integration of implicit background knowledge"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02318) [S32].
- **GSM-Symbolic** (2024-10): pure-neural reasoning is perturbation-fragile — ["Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229) [S29].
- **AlphaGeometry** (Nature 2024): the field's flagship result — the 2024 review found ["only one entry at the intersection of all 4 of the main research focal areas"](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.05435v1): AlphaGeometry [S1][S28].

## Durable core (foundations an expert still leans on)
- **Logic-LM / LINC** (2023) — the canonical parser+solver pattern: the LLM translates; ["These expressions are then offloaded to an external theorem prover, which symbolically performs deductive inference."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15164) [S26][S24]. Self-refinement = the solver's error messages fed back [S24].
- **DeepProbLog / DeepStochLog / Scallop / Logic Tensor Networks** — settled probabilistic-differentiable canon; know them, do not re-propose them [S1][S2].
- **Kautz coupling taxonomy + Garcez & Lamb third-wave framing** — the field's shared vocabulary [S2][S4].

## Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)
Saturated threads with strong 2025–26 work; adding to them is incremental. The blank space is NOT here:
1. **Accuracy ≠ faithfulness diagnosis** — the gap is documented across [S5][S6][S7]; merely diagnosing it again is months late. Nuance inside the lane: the "formalization gaming" headline is already contested [S6].
2. **Interventional / counterfactual faithfulness** — a named lane: RFEval [S21]; Executable Counterfactuals — which itself notes existing evals ["tend to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01539) [S17]; label-flip evaluation with judge-model selection (Truth-or-Twist [S22] — a judge-selection study, not a proof-DAG benchmark).
3. **Proof-DAG / counterfactual-twin benchmarks** — LogicGraph already ships solver-verified, exhaustive minimal-proof sets [S19]; LogiConBench is a further lead (403-blocked; candidate lane).
4. **Bare NL→FOL translators** — saturated since Logic-LM/LINC 2023 [S24][S26]; ["state-of-the-art, dialogue-oriented LLMs demonstrate strong NL-FOL translation skills"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11816) [S23]. Another translator is incremental.
5. **Per-axiom / per-step source-grounded ATTESTATION at the formalization seam** — grounding each formal atom or CoT step in an identified source premise + a solver/entailment check is an occupied lane: VeriCoT types each step's grounding premise and finds validity ["serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662) [S10], and premise-correspondence / scope-laundering checks already probe the same seam [S5][S7]. "Gate every premise against the source" re-treads this — the open move is what these do NOT do (e.g. defeating *shared-bias* mistranslation, not just per-premise support).
6. **Reverse-direction / NL-first, solver-certified benchmarks** — real-text (not template) inputs, expert-audited + Z3-checked, scored on formalization faithfulness: an active 2026 lane — LLMEval-Logic ["verifies annotated answers with Z3, constructs expert rubrics for natural-to-formal grading"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.19597) [S33]. "A reverse-direction certified benchmark" as the contribution re-treads it; only a distinct axis (e.g. a synthetic→natural transfer diagnostic) stays open.

## Open questions the field hasn't answered (the whole lens — answer in your own way)
1. Canonical pipelines equated accuracy boosts with ["a promising avenue for faithful logical reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12295) [S24]; 2026 evidence shows the gain ["does not imply faithful reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16118) [S5]. What property should a text→logic system be optimized and reported on — and what evidence would let a faithfulness claim survive both [S5]'s divergence protocol and [S6]'s two-stage protocol?
2. A solver in the loop is assumed to transfer soundness to the user-visible answer — ["a solver produces a sound and independently verifiable answer"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.19588) — yet ["the soundness guarantee can be lost in the interaction between the solver and the model"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.19588) [S27], scope laundering ["persists across all models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16118) [S5], while a Lean-4 study finds no systematic gaming under unified generation [S6]. Where along NL → formalization → execution → reported answer does soundness actually leak, and what task / pipeline-split / model differences reconcile the clashing results?
3. Per-step validators exist [S10] and roundtrip equivalence certification covers translation [S9], but there is no agreed gold-free faithfulness metric (as of 2026-07). What would a gold-free, process-level faithfulness measure have to certify for the field to accept it as a primary reported number?
4. Prover-synthesis provides gold chains [S25] and exhaustive minimal-proof sets [S19], while hand-curated gold is ~36–39% wrong [S13] — yet accuracy is still the primary reported metric. What blocks process-level scoring from becoming the default, and what would unblock it?
5. The independence assumption is ubiquitous for tractability yet formally ["entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain concept combinations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11357) [S14]. Where does this limitation actually bite on realistic tasks — and does the community's scepticism that it rarely matters hold up?
6. An upper ontology is assumed to supply clean background structure, but peer-reviewed evidence shows NL-term embeddings collide with formal term syntax, yielding hallucinated terms [S18], while high-assurance framings demand defeasible, evidence-grounded reasoning [S16]. What is ontology grounding actually good for in an LLM-era pipeline — and at what integration cost?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)
| Deep / killed | Contrast | Separating cue · reopening condition | src |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AlphaGeometry (Nature 2024): dissolved the structural bottleneck (proof-data scarcity) — ["sidesteps the need for human demonstrations by synthesizing millions of theorems and proofs"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06747-5) | AlphaGeometry2: same recipe scaled/tuned — ["we have significantly boosted the overall solving rate of AG to 84%"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03544) (from 54%) | deep = attack the bottleneck so a new capability becomes possible; incremental = push the same paradigm's number | [S28][S31] |
| killed: the bare NL→FOL translator as the contribution | dismissal (2025-11): SOTA dialogue LLMs translate sentence-level logic well [S23] | reopen where translation still fails: beyond sentence level (long documents; dense modal/temporal/higher-order logic), or where ["embedding-centric models perform markedly worse"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11816) | [S23] |
| killed: purely-neural end-to-end reasoners | dismissal (2024-10): ["current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229); compositional collapse [S30] | reopen only on demonstrated out-of-distribution, clause-count-robust reasoning that clears the GSM-Symbolic bar | [S29][S30] |
| killed: trusting FOLIO/MALLS original gold labels | dismissal (2026-06): ~39%/36% incorrect formalizations [S13] | reopen via the released corrected splits — relabeling framework reached ["90% dataset accuracy after reviewing fewer than 24% of instances"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.02837) | [S13] |

The line as THIS field draws it: contributions are weighed on principled integration serving trust/interpretability [S4], and the under-served areas (explainability & trust ~28%, meta-cognition ~5% [S1]) are where work reads deep — not another accuracy point on a saturated translator [S23].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)
| Naive move | Expert move | Why (failure prevented) | src |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Evaluate NL→FOL on FOLIO/MALLS as shipped | Use the corrected re-annotations or prover-synthesized sets; state which labels you scored on | ~39%/36% wrong gold; +9–22pp label-noise swings → wrong-result | [S13][S25] |
| Read compilation / typecheck / accuracy as faithfulness evidence | Measure faithfulness separately, on the reported answer | compilation rates ≉ faithful reasoning [S6]; typecheck+provable can encode a different theorem [S7] → wrong-result | [S6][S5][S7] |
| Default to prompting the largest reasoning LLM for NL→FOL | Also benchmark a fine-tuned small encoder-decoder and supply the predicate list | predicate availability +15–20%; T5-XXL beats GPT-4o / R1-0528 → wasted-cost | [S8] |
| Formalize the whole document and forward-chain | Weigh selective, confidence-aware translation and hypothesis-driven backward reasoning | forward-only: redundant paths, hallucinated steps, semantic drift → wrong-result | [S20] |
| Assume ontology terms ground cleanly | Test formal-term grounding separately (NL-embedding / term-syntax collision) | hallucinated non-existent terms in SUO-KIF-style languages → wrong-result | [S18] |
| Score reasoning against one gold proof chain | Account for alternate minimal proofs (multi-path eval) | penalizes valid derivations; distorts process scores → wrong-result | [S19] |

## Decision guide
- **Benchmark choice:** template sets (RuleTaker/ProofWriter) when you need scale + control and accept shortcut risk; FOLIO/MALLS ONLY with corrected labels [S13]; ProverQA for contamination-resistant, chain-accessible eval [S25]; LogicGraph when multiple valid proofs matter [S19].
- **Intermediate representation:** verifiable code (SymPy-style) when the domain is computational math [S11]; logic forms when deduction/entailment is itself the object [S24][S26].
- **Probabilistic substrate:** independence-assuming predictors (DeepProbLog/Scallop lane) buy tractability but formally cannot represent uncertainty over some concept combinations [S14] — decide by whether that uncertainty is load-bearing for the task.
- **Sourcing:** most 2025–26 results above are arXiv preprints; [S18] (PMLR) and the 2023–25 EMNLP/ICLR/Nature anchors are the peer-reviewed exceptions — prefer published versions for load-bearing claims (volatile.md tracks status).

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)
- LLM = semantic parser, solver = deterministic inference — the Logic-LM/LINC division of labor [S24][S26].
- Self-refinement = feed the solver's error messages back to revise formalizations [S24].
- NL→FOL's named key challenge: implicit background knowledge the text leaves unstated [S32].
- Template benchmarks: scalable but simplistic; hand-curated: small + contamination-prone; prover-synthesis is the scalable route [S25].
- Scope laundering = reporting a solver-inconsistent verdict without executing the formal reasoning; sibling failure modes: implicit-constraint blindness, program-synthesis errors [S5].
- text2logic sits at Kautz type 3 ("Neural | Symbolic") on the coupling map [S2].
- Knowledge extraction is the stated main computational bottleneck at scale [S2].

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)
- ⚠️ **LogiConBench** (OpenReview forum id ULEHJkolxB; reportedly ICLR 2026, controllable-depth reasoning graphs) — PDF returned HTTP 403 during mining; lead only. If confirmed, it further crowds lane 3. Confirm via OpenReview.
- ⚠️ **FRIT** (intervention-training for faithfulness) and **SATBench** (EMNLP 2025) — named by the tool-equipped baseline, not independently fetched; their lanes are confirmed by [S21][S19] regardless. Fetch abstracts before citing either.
- ⚠️ **Driftbench** — real: 2,183 NL/Lean-4 ["pairs with controlled drift labels across six subfields of mathlib4"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16541), released by [S7], NOT by the formalization-gaming paper a search snippet attributed it to; [S7] is a quality-flagged single preprint, so treat as a lead until corroborated.
- ⚠️ **NeSy 2026 logistics** (Lisbon, Sep 1–4; PMLR; OpenReview, 10pg full / 5pg short; X-NeSy special issue) — from a live baseline fetch whose quote was not retained. Confirm at nesyconf.org before venue planning.
